The resulting yellow slurry was warmed to _30_ C. over 40 min and maintained at that temperature for an additional 15 min. The resulting dark orange-red slurry was cooled to _78_ C., and a THF (20 mL) solution of 29 (4.98 g, 18.8 mmol, 0.9 equiv.) was added, followed by two THF (10 mL) rinses of the flask that contained 29. At the end of the initial addition of 29, the slurry became faint yellow, and it was allowed to warm slowly to 0_ C. over 3.5 h. The slurry was then quenched with H2O at 0_ C., producing a mild effervescence. The mixture was warmed to room temperature and extracted thrice with EtOAc. The organic extracts were combined, washed with H2O and brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo to a yellow oil.

After 20 hours at ambient temperature, the reaction mixture was partitioned between saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (50 mL) and dichloromethane (75 mL). The organic phase was separated, dried (Na2SO4), filtered and evaporated in-vacuo. The resultant residue was purified by flash chromatography (silica, Biotage 100 g column, 0-10% methanol in dichloromethane) to afford crude 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-[1,4__bipiperidinyl-1_-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester. This crude material was dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL) and TFA (2 mL) added. After 30 minutes at ambient temperature, the reaction mixture was concentrated in-vacuo and the resultant residue loaded onto a 20 g SCX-2 cartridge which was washed with methanol, then 2N ammonia in methanol. Concentration of the combined basic fractions in-vacuo afforded the title compound as a colourless oil (285 mg, 40% over two steps). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3): 3.15 (d, J=12.3 Hz, 2H), 2.62-2.60 (m, 6H), 2.42-2.39 (m, 1H), 1.84 (d, J=12.6 Hz, 2H), 1.67-1.64 (m, 5H), 1.46-1.44 (m, 2H), 1.24 (s, 3H).","{

The solution was stirred at room temperature for about 70 minutes before the dropwise addition of a solution of methyl iodide (14 ml. 0.22 mol) in DMF (1.0 ml). The reaction was monitored by lc/ms for the consumption of SM and the appearance of O and N-methyl products. After 2.5 hours of stirring at r.t, conversion was about 30% and about 5% N-methyl product had formed. The reaction was stopped when an increase of N-Me to O-Me had been observed and conversion was about 50%. The brown solution was diluted with ethyl acetate and washed several times with water and finally brine. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and condensed.

The reaction mixture was warmed to 60_ C. before freshly ground sodium tertbutoxide was added in one portion to start the reaction.

After 10 min., the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to rt. After 1 h, the reaction mixture was cooled to _78_ C., and a solution of 1-benzyl 4-tert-butyl 2-formylpiperazine-1,4-dicarboxylate (3.07 g, 8.81 mmol) in THF (10 mL) was added dropwise. After 2 h, the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to rt and was quenched with NH4Cl (saturated, aqueous solution). The reaction mixture was diluted with water (100 mL) and was extracted with EtOAc (3_150 mL). The combined organics were dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification by column chromatography (0 to 20% EtOAc in Hexane gradient) gave 2.33 g (76%) of the desired product as a thick oil. Rf=0.35 in 30% EtOAc/Hexane.
